        "Although logistic regression is one of the most commonly used classification algorithms, it is not the only one. If the underlying relationship between the logit of odds and the covariates is not linear, we need to consider higher order terms of the covariates to make the logistic model valid. Doing so requires a lot of tuning and experimenting. In such cases, it is often better to look at a classification algorithm that does not rely on a specific assumption about the relationship between the probability of the outcome and the covariates. Therefore we are going to introduce some of the most popular models"

Thus, in order to estimate $\\text{P(covariates=values given non-defaulter)}$ we would need at least $1024$ samples!
